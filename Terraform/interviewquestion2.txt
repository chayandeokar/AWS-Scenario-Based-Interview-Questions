ðŸ”¹ Question 1: Importing Existing Resources into Terraform Configuration:
Use the terraform import command to bring existing resources under Terraform management.
Syntax: terraform import RESOURCE_TYPE.NAME RESOURCE_ID
Example: terraform import aws_instance.my_instance i-1234567890abcdef0

ðŸ”¹ Question 2: Implementing Highly Available Architecture with Auto Scaling Group:
Define an Auto Scaling Group with multiple EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones.
Attach a load balancer (e.g., ELB, ALB) to distribute incoming traffic among instances.

ðŸ”¹ Question 3: Structuring Terraform Code for Multi-Cloud Management:
Organize Terraform code into separate directories for AWS and Azure configurations.
Use separate state files and variables to manage resources on each cloud provider.

ðŸ”¹ Question 4: Previewing Execution Plan in Terraform:
Use the terraform plan command to preview changes before applying.
Review the execution plan to ensure desired changes and identify potential issues.

ðŸ”¹ Question 5: Integrating Terraform with Git for GitOps:
Use version control systems like Git to store Terraform configurations.
Implement GitOps practices by triggering Terraform runs via CI/CD pipelines on Git commits.

ðŸ”¹ Question 6: Managing Infrastructure Secrets in Terraform:
Utilize third-party secrets management providers like Vault.
Store sensitive data in encrypted state files or external secret stores.

ðŸ”¹ Question 7: Using terraform taint for Resource Management:
Use terraform taint to mark resources for recreation during the next apply.
Helps in cases where resource state is corrupted or requires re-creation due to external changes.

ðŸ”¹ Question 8: Structuring CI/CD Pipeline for Terraform with GitLab CI/CD:
Define stages for Terraform plan, apply, and destroy in CI/CD pipeline.
Utilize GitLab CI/CD features like triggers and environment variables for configuration.
