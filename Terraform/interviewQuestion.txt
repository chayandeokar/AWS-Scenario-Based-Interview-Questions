ðŸ”¹ Question 1: Structuring Terraform Configurations for Code Reuse:
Utilize Terraform modules to encapsulate reusable components.
Organize modules by environment (e.g., dev, prod) to handle specific configurations.

ðŸ”¹ Question 2: Using Terraform Remote Backend for State Management:
Use remote backends (e.g., S3, Azure Blob Storage) to store Terraform state remotely.
Advantages include centralized state management, collaboration support, and improved security.

ðŸ”¹ Question 3: Running Scripts after Provisioning with Terraform:
Utilize provisioners (e.g., local-exec, remote-exec) to execute scripts after resource creation.
Use provisioner blocks within resource definitions to specify post-provisioning actions.

ðŸ”¹ Question 4: Managing Sensitive Information in Terraform Configuration:
Utilize Terraform sensitive data type for sensitive values.
Store sensitive data in environment variables or use third-party secrets management tools.

ðŸ”¹ Question 5: Using Terraform Workspaces for Project Structuring:
Use workspaces to manage multiple deployments of the same infrastructure.
Organize projects with separate directories for each workspace and maintain separate state files.

ðŸ”¹ Question 6: Implementing Consistent Environment Configuration:
Use Terraform modules to define standardized infrastructure components.
Maintain separate environments (e.g., dev, prod) with consistent configurations across environments.

ðŸ”¹ Question 7: Migrating Infrastructure from Terraform v0.11 to v0.12:
Review Terraform v0.12 release notes and documentation for backward incompatible changes.
Update Terraform configuration syntax and address any deprecated features.
